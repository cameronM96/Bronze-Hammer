| Voxel Series - Dungeon Set |
+----------------------------+

Thank you for purchasing the Voxel Series - Dungeon Set! Here is some information you might
find useful.

For ProGrid users, I recommend setting the grid to 0.1 for 1:1 snapping. If you need finer
control, then 0.05 would be the next step.

If you are making fixed dungeons (as in, not procedural / randomly generated) then I recommend
combining the meshes using various scripts that are widely available. This will help clean up
the heiarchy and *may* help with performance if you are running too many single tiles. Always
keep a non-combined version for backup / editing reasons.
